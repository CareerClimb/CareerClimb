        "description": "Petal is a leading Canadian healthcare orchestration and billing company that revolutionizes healthcare systems to make them agile, efficient, and resilient by enabling the forecasting and shaping of world-class healthcare through Healthcare BI, advanced analytics, and informed insights.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nOur commitment to fostering an exceptional workplace culture has earned us notable recognitions, including being listed as a **Great Place to Work** in both the technology and healthcare sectors. Join us in our mission to empower healthcare innovators and improve healthcare differently.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n**Let's** **talk Tech Stack**\n\n\nThe technologies you will work with in Petal's existing ecosystem are **MySQL**, **Elasticsearch**, and **Azure DB** for our foundational products.\n\n\nThe backend stack of our applications that interact with these databases is primarily composed of Ruby on Rails and .NET, in a monolithic architecture.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nWe are currently undergoing a technological transition and a major overhaul of our main products, so you will mainly work on new relational and document database models, such as MongoDB, in modern event-driven and microservices architectures.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nWe are a SaaS company that aims to implement the best DevOps approaches. Our infrastructures are cloud-based, entirely as code with **Terraform**, and our latest applications are managed by container and deployed under **Kubernetes**. Automating the deployment pipeline is a priority for us, and we use various platforms, including **GitLab**, for implementation. We firmly believe in a **continuous deployment** approach and have achieved high maturity in this regard, deploying code to production environments multiple times a day.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nOur web and mobile applications use modern tools such as **Angular** and **React Native**, **RxJS**, **Redux**, and **Storybook**. Quality is at the core of our principles, and all this code is tested using frameworks such as **Jest**, **Playwright**, as well as end-to-end testing libraries and services.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n**What you can expect when joining the team**\n\n\nReporting to the Director of Software Development, you will play a key and central role within the various product development teams and the Petal platform as an expert in database development, modelling, and designing efficient and secure database solutions. You will work with software development leaders to design, evaluate, implement, and optimize database models and systems, as well as train people on best practices.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n**Your daily life**\n\n\nIn your day to day, you will be led to:\n\n\n* Understand the challenges of data management and operations and develop effective and appropriate solutions;\n* Design and implement efficient and secure database solutions, migration solutions, and data persistence management over time;\n* Evaluate existing database systems to identify areas for improvement;\n* Collaborate with the development team to design optimized database schemas;\n* Establish data backup and recovery procedures in collaboration with the teams that will operate these databases;\n* Ensure the performance, security, availability, and integrity of the databases;\nTrain and establish best practices among software developers and other stakeholders.  \n* \n  \n\n  \n\n**Your profile**\n\n\nAre you an experienced and motivated database expert, known for your positive attitude, work ethic, as well as your technical and interpersonal skills? Are you valued for your ability to identify issues and respond with effective solutions and approaches? Are you driven by the unique opportunity to contribute to a greater cause in the healthcare industry through innovative solutions based on people, data, and technology? *The sky is the limit!* If you have:\n\n\n* Over 5 years of proven experience as a database architect;\n* A degree in computer science or a related field;\n* Excellent knowledge of relational database management systems like MySQL and Azure DB;\n* Excellent knowledge of the data indexing and search software ElasticSearch;\n* Excellent knowledge in SQL query optimization and various approaches to optimizing data access and storage;\n* A good understanding of data protection principles and legislation;\n* Good knowledge of using an ORM in development and its impacts on data modeling;\n* Good knowledge of best data management practices in a microservices or event-driven architecture;\n* Solid experience in product or software development as a database expert in agile delivery;\n* The ability to work well in a team and communicate effectively;\n* Experience in software development in web or microservices contexts (an asset);\n* Good knowledge of document-oriented database management systems like MongoDB (an asset);\nSince you will be regularly interacting with English-speaking colleagues located outside of Québec, proficiency in both English and French (spoken, written, and read) is preferable.  \n* \n\n  \n\n**Petal’s position on remote working**\n\n\nIn our opinion, a company cannot claim to be modern, innovative and have the well-being of their team at heart, without attempting to integrate remote working to the level that their business model allows them to. Petal employees continue to benefit from the option of teleworking up to the maximum flexibility permitted by the nature of the position and the smooth running of operations.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n**Our benefits**\n\n\n* A signing bonus of $1,000 for your remote work set-up;\n* Compensation that recognizes your contribution;\n* 4 to 6 weeks of paid vacation per year;\n* 5 paid personal days per year;\n* A group RRSP / DPSP plan with employer contribution;\n* A complete group insurance plan, from day 1;\n* An annual wellness allowance;\n* Access to the Lumino Health™ telehealth application;\n* Flexible work hours and more.\n *Petal is an active participant in the equal opportunity employment program, and members of the following target groups are encouraged to apply: women, people with disabilities, aboriginal peoples and visible minorities.

Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n   \n\n  \n\n**About The Team**\n Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.\n   \n\n  \n\n What you’ll do\n   \n\n  \n\n As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Responsibilities**\n* Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.\n* Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.\n* Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.\n* Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.\n* Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.\n* Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.\n\n\n Who you are\n   \n\n  \n\n We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Minimum Requirements**\n* 8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets\n* Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field\n* Proficiency in SQL and Python\n* Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams\n* Strong knowledge of statistics\n* Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals\n* Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail\n* Outstanding written and verbal communication skills\n\n\n**Preferred Qualifications**\n* Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field\n* Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication\n* Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight\n* Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)\n\n\n Hybrid work at Stripe\n   \n\n  \n\n This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).\n   \n\n  \n\n Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.\n   \n\n  \n\n A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.\n   \n\n  \n\n Pay and benefits\n   \n\n  \n\n The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.\n   \n\n  \n\n Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",
