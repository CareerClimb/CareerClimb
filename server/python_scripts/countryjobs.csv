Two Barrels is hiring a Software Engineer. You will be a traditional company employee. This is a full time 40 hour/week position with company benefits. This is a remote position. Our main office is in Spokane WA, and we have satellite offices in Austin TX and Salt Lake City UT. This is a broad role that encompasses a lot of potential skill sets. Keep reading for more details.



At Two Barrels, you will work with a close-knit group of engineers who come from a diverse mix of backgrounds and experiences. We build out exciting new Rails projects, as well as maintain and refactor older Rack-based ones built in “plain old Ruby”. We are constantly evolving, growing and willing to try new technologies and techniques, as long as we meet the business’s needs.



We want someone who is eager to learn and help others but can also take on a project independently and be just fine. Our team supports each other and understands not everyone is the same – some of us are great at CI/CD development, some of us are wizards at SQL, and others just love Plain Old Ruby – meaning although we expect you to work the full-stack, we also understand if you prefer to work in one area more than another.



This position has quite a large pay range. We will evaluate throughout the recruiting process where we see you best falling in that range. If you meet just the minimum requirements, you’ll likely fall on the lower end. If you meet minimum plus some preferred, you’ll be more in the middle. If you’re a candidate who can pretty much check every box, you’ll find yourself at the higher end of this scale.


**How to Apply:**



Please apply through the link below. It’s a coding job, so showing us some code would be helpful. Preferably a flavor of Ruby or Javascript, but anything for now will do. We like to see where your passion lies so these could be side projects, big or small.


**What’s in a title?**



Here at Two Barrels we don’t take titles very seriously. We know for recruiting purposes we need to call our jobs something, so we started with labeling and differentiating them in a fairly traditional way with “junior, mid, senior”. However, we’ve realized that was putting our employees in a box and wasn’t allowing us to uniquely identify their individual contributions, strengths and professional goals. Once you join our team the titles kinda get dropped as we expect everyone to work with everyone regardless of title or experience. We have taken the approach of evaluating candidates and employees on a “level” basis. It makes it a little easier internally to talk about growing into the next level without there being this huge chasm between what it means to be a Junior Engineer vs. a Mid Engineer. Our levels have expectations set for each one and it’s the responsibility of the manager and employee to make sure there is alignment. We do this through quarterly conversations where we discuss employee progression, if the work is challenging, and to ensure they feel fairly compensated for their work and expertise. Basically, levels gives us more flexibility to help people grow in their careers. But sure, you can post your title on LinkedIn as what makes sense to the rest of the world.

===================


At every company, there's someone whose most painful job is wrangling CSV files in Excel. OneSchema (oneschema.co) makes cleanup of messy CSVs 10x faster (demo). Our product is an embeddable spreadsheet that makes data cleansing and import as simple as a few clicks. We see an incredible opportunity to be the de-facto data transfer platform for all industries that run on CSV files (hint: it’s all of them). We get our customers out of spreadsheets and back to the meaningful, creative work they love.


We are backed by top investors including General Catalyst, Sequoia Capital, and Y Combinator. And as a rapidly growing seed-stage company, every team member has the chance to have a major impact on our business. Compensation is competitive - we expect employees to act like owners and make sure their equity stake reflects that.


Because we are a highly collaborative, close-knit team, **our entire engineering team works 5 days per week from our office in downtown San Francisco**.

**About the role**
==================


We’re looking for a full-time Senior Software Engineer. You will go 0 to 1 on new product initiatives as well as scaling our core platform to handle millions of file imports monthly. You will be given a lot of autonomy, and the chance to learn in one week what it would take one month to learn elsewhere. Our stack consists of Ruby, Rust, Typescript, and React. We use Postgres, Redis, and S3 for data storage.


If you thrive when given a great degree of ownership and enjoy a trusting, casual, growth-minded environment alongside highly driven teammates, this could be a perfect fit.

**What you’ll do**
------------------

* You will own the end to end execution of projects that solve customer pain.
* You will work directly with customers to build context and scope projects that fit their needs.
* You will troubleshoot and resolve complex technical issues across the entire stack.
* You will develop and implement strategies for improving the performance, reliability, and scalability of our platform that supports CSVs with thousands of columns and millions of rows.
* You will review pull requests, design documents, and architecture decisions to ensure system quality.
* You will be the primary owner of core product areas and develop domain expertise over those systems. Examples include our in memory Rust data service that executes all of our spreadsheet validations and transforms on massive spreadsheets and our version control system which allows customers to safely build experiences in OneSchema in sync with their deploy processes.
* You will work directly with the Design, Customer Engineering, and GTM team to understand the customer and make decisions on the product that will lead to a better user experience.

**Who you are**
===============

**Essentials:**
---------------

* 7+ years of relevant fullstack or backend software engineering experience
* Comfortable with ambiguity. Excited about wearing multiple hats in a fast-moving environment. Able to hustle to drive results
* Self-driven, self-motivated, fast learner. Ability to own open-ended projects end-to-end.

**Even better if you:**
-----------------------

* Have experience with Rust, Ruby, Typescript, React, SQL, AWS
* Have expertise building customer-facing SDKs, external APIs or other developer tools
* Have previous startup experience and/or experience going zero to one with new initiatives.

**Benefits**
============

* Competitive compensation with meaningful stock options
* Medical, Dental and Vision plans
* Daily lunch and dinner in office
* Monthly team offsites and biannual company retreats
* Quarterly wellness budget
* 401k
* Unlimited PTO and sick days
* Parental leave
* Professional development budget
* Mentorship from engineering leaders


For this role, the estimated base salary range is between $130k-$170k. Base salaries are just one component of the total compensation package and are determined by a number of factors such as years of experience, expertise, qualifications and more. In addition to base salary, we offer competitive equity packages, health, dental and 401(k) contributions that play a big part in recognizing you for the huge impact you will have on helping us achieve our mission.

 The Mission
   

  

 The next wave of ML applications (video security, conversational AI and autonomous vehicles) is going to look very different from the last one (search and recommender systems). Teams working in these domains have to deal with large streams of unstructured data (images, video, text and audio), exorbitant labeling costs, and broken feedback loops. For this next wave of ML applications, getting to production takes months and adapting to the long tail is an existential struggle. That’s what we’re solving - Refuel.ai accelerates time to production for ML applications built on top of unstructured data, and enables them to continually improve in the real world.
   

  

 The team
   

  

 Refuel.ai was founded in 2021 by Rishabh Bhargava and Nihit Desai. Our founders bring machine learning and product experience from the world's leading technology companies (Facebook, Instagram, Primer.ai and Cloudera) and institutions (Stanford, Cambridge and UIUC). We are backed by General Catalyst, XYZ Ventures and a host of successful and influential angel investors from places like Stanford, OpenAI, Datadog and Facebook.
   

  

 What you will do
   

  

* Build our web application frontend. Frameworks/languages you will use on a regular basis include React, NextJS, Javascript and CSS
* Work closely with our design and engineering teams to implement new features and own them across the product life cycle.
* Prototype and rapidly experiment with new product features and UI improvements in response to customer feedback
* Help define and evolve our engineering stack as we scale the product
* Help us hire a world-class team and mentor new team members


 You will be a great fit if you have
   

  

* Expertise with building frontend applications using React and Javascript
* The ability and passion to lead product-defining initiatives from ideation to execution while maintaining a high bar for design and correctness
* Strong communication skills and enjoy working in a collaborative environment. We encourage open discussion and want the best ideas to win
* A curiosity about the company building journey
* Bonus: prior experience with building interactive frontend interfaces for data-intensive software applications


 Our current tech stack
   

  

* Infrastructure - AWS + Serverless + Kubernetes + secret sauce infra to power modern ML
* Backend - Python + FastAPI + Postgres + DynamoDB
* Frontend - React + Typescript


 What we offer
   

  

 We have raised funding from top-tier investors, including General Catalyst, XYZ Ventures and a host of successful angel investors from places such as Stanford, OpenAI, Facebook and Datadog. We will offer a competitive salary and meaningful equity in the company.
   

  

 Most importantly, you will have the opportunity to create a massive impact on the product and company as a member of our early team. We care a lot about making a difference for our customers while working on a team where we are empowered to do the best work of our lives.","https://www.linkedin.com/company/refuelai","","","","","","","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D560BAQHOK57ZDaMURQ/company-logo_100_100/0/1687752897761/refuelai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=LNcPReZcBp3nS0z0BrBt7LfUwq9t7UK2ii5V2Kh4H94","","",""

 We’re fixing one of the most broken and costly pieces of the US healthcare system: medical billing.
   

  

 Today, healthcare providers spend over $250B each year on administrative overhead just to get paid by insurance. Medical billing is expensive because it’s nuanced and hard - maybe ~100x harder than credit card payment processing - and because it’s traditionally done by armies of humans who track and manage complex rules and processes specific to individual insurance companies with little or no supporting software.
   

  

 We’re rethinking medical billing from the ground up, building software backed by best-in-class data science (and, soon, a dash of machine learning) to automate much of this complexity so healthcare providers can get paid dramatically more easily and inexpensively.
   

  

 We were in the Y Combinator W20 batch and have since been well funded by a world-class group of funds (8VC, First Round Capital, BoxGroup) + angel investors. We're now helping our customers treat opioid addiction, provide holistic care for women, lose weight, increase access to mental health care, and much more. This is such important and gratifying work; we can't wait for you to join our team and help support some of the most important innovation happening in healthcare today!
   

  

 Our values
   

  

 We spend at least as much time with our coworkers as we do with our closest friends + family - if we intend to do the most important + challenging work of our lives, it’s important that these folks energize us, support us, inspire us, and push us to do our best work. This is what you can expect of your teammates at Candid (in no particular order): - We put our customers first - We take care of each other and ourselves - We anchor on outcomes and work relentlessly and creatively to achieve them - We collectively prioritize building a diverse and inclusive workspace - We believe humility is our greatest strength - We are candid, kind, and committed - We strive to be the most prepared person in the room - We are truth seekers
   

  

 What you’ll be doing
   

  

* You’ll conceptualize, design, build, and maintain complex services/platforms/features and develop ownership over large swaths of our product + infrastructure.
* You’ll interact closely with our current + prospective customers, developing intuition around their biggest pain points and thinking of creative ways to address them.
* You’ll play a critical role in shaping our engineering + broader company culture and help make this the best place we’ve ever worked.

 We’re fixing one of the most broken and costly pieces of the US healthcare system: medical billing.
   

  

 Today, healthcare providers spend over $250B each year on administrative overhead just to get paid by insurance. Medical billing is expensive because it’s nuanced and hard - maybe ~100x harder than credit card payment processing - and because it’s traditionally done by armies of humans who track and manage complex rules and processes specific to individual insurance companies with little or no supporting software.
   

  

 We’re rethinking medical billing from the ground up, building software backed by best-in-class data science (and, soon, a dash of machine learning) to automate much of this complexity so healthcare providers can get paid dramatically more easily and inexpensively.
   

  

 We were in the Y Combinator W20 batch and have since been well funded by a world-class group of funds (8VC, First Round Capital, BoxGroup) + angel investors. We're now helping our customers treat opioid addiction, provide holistic care for women, lose weight, increase access to mental health care, and much more. This is such important and gratifying work; we can't wait for you to join our team and help support some of the most important innovation happening in healthcare today!
   

  

 Our values
   

  

 We spend at least as much time with our coworkers as we do with our closest friends + family - if we intend to do the most important + challenging work of our lives, it’s important that these folks energize us, support us, inspire us, and push us to do our best work. This is what you can expect of your teammates at Candid (in no particular order): - We put our customers first - We take care of each other and ourselves - We anchor on outcomes and work relentlessly and creatively to achieve them - We collectively prioritize building a diverse and inclusive workspace - We believe humility is our greatest strength - We are candid, kind, and committed - We strive to be the most prepared person in the room - We are truth seekers
   

  

 What you’ll be doing
   

  

* You’ll conceptualize, design, build, and maintain complex services/platforms/features and develop ownership over large swaths of our product + infrastructure.
* You’ll interact closely with our current + prospective customers, developing intuition around their biggest pain points and thinking of creative ways to address them.
* You’ll play a critical role in shaping our engineering + broader company culture and help make this the best place we’ve ever worked.
